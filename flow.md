## Flow Overview

### 1. Your Django App  
→ **Calls** `generate_test_cases("test login functionality")`

The user interacts with your web interface and submits a prompt describing the desired functionality to test.

---

### 2. Your Code  
→ **Creates a request payload**

Your backend Python logic constructs a properly formatted JSON payload with the prompt and relevant parameters to be sent to the API.

---

### 3. GitHub Models API  
→ **Processes with GPT-4.1**

The payload is sent to the GitHub-hosted OpenAI model endpoint. The GPT-4.1 model processes the input and generates relevant test cases.

---

### 4. AI Model Response  
→ **Returns a JSON string**

The response from the API includes a structured JSON string containing the generated test cases and potentially automation code snippets.

---

### 5. Your Code  
→ **Parses and validates**

The backend receives the response, parses the JSON, validates the structure, and prepares the data for display.

---

### 6. Django App  
→ **Displays test cases to user**

Finally, the frontend displays the generated test cases clearly to the user within the Django application interface.

---

## Summary

This flow efficiently bridges user input and AI-powered test case generation, delivering structured and actionable test scripts through a seamless Django interface.
